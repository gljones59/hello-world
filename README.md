Hi!

Just setting up a new Github account.

I've been programming for over 30 years.  Some of you may have read about IBM Assembler on punch cards in history class.  I lived it!  Also FORTRAN, DEC Assmebler, Borland C, Cold Fusion, MS-SQL, ASP .NET and then some more modern languages of late.

Most recently I've been working in PHP along with JavaScript and jQuery.  Along the way I ventured into the management side and have held CTO and COO roles with some major public companies, but hands-on coding has always been my first love and I've never gone for too long of a period of time without doing some hands-on coding work.

Now I'm looking to learn more about Github and some other technologies such as node.js and angular.js plus MVC patterns, single page apps and more.

Onward...
